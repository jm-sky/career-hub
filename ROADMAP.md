## üéØ Immediate Next Steps

### Today's Actions
1. **Start Authentication System**
   - Implement User model with ULID primary keys
   - Create JWT service with refresh tokens
   - Build registration/login endpoints
   - Add password hashing with bcrypt

### This Week's Goals
- Complete authentication backend
- Build auth frontend components
- Test login/registration flow
- Set up protected routes

### Success Criteria for Sprint 1
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can login and receive JWT tokens
- [ ] Frontend shows logged-in state
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login
- [ ] Password reset flow works
- [ ] All auth endpoints tested

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Development Metrics
- **Total Features**: 45+ planned
- **Completed**: 8 (project setup)
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Remaining**: 37+

### Technical Debt
- [ ] API responses need camelCase format (noted from user input)
- [ ] API requests expect camelCase params (noted from user input)
- [ ] Error handling standardization needed
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation pending

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **No current blockers** - ready to proceed
- Documentation complete
- Development environment ready
- All dependencies identified

## üîÑ Weekly Review Process

### Sprint Planning (Every Monday)
1. Review previous sprint completion
2. Update progress percentages
3. Identify blockers or scope changes
4. Plan current sprint tasks
5. Update this roadmap

### Daily Standup Questions
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What am I working on today?
3. Are there any blockers?
4. Should I update the roadmap?

## üéØ MVP Launch Criteria

### Essential Features for Launch
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] Profile wizard with draft saving
- [ ] Experience management CRUD
- [ ] Basic CV generation (1 template)
- [ ] PDF export functional
- [ ] Public profile accessible
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Production deployment

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Page load < 2 seconds
- [ ] PDF generation < 5 seconds
- [ ] 99% uptime
- [ ] Mobile responsive design

### Security Requirements
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Input validation everywhere
- [ ] Security headers configured

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### API Format Decision
- **Issue**: API responses should use camelCase (noted from user memory)
- **Action Needed**: Update Pydantic models to use camelCase aliases
- **Priority**: High - implement during auth system

### Recent Decisions
- ‚úÖ Tech stack finalized (FastAPI + Next.js)
- ‚úÖ ULID chosen over UUID for IDs
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL JSONB for flexible data
- ‚úÖ Service layer pattern confirmed

### Open Questions
- AI provider choice (OpenAI vs Anthropic)
- Payment processor selection
- Deployment platform decision
- Monitoring solution choice
